# Programming Languages & Logic Reading Group
This repo contains resources related to the PL & Logic reading group. This reading group follows
[**Classic Papers in Programming Languages and Logic**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/ ) seminar by
Chris Crary at CMU.


# First Step: 
Join these Telegram channels and groups: 
- Mr Khoushechin channel [Kc channel](https://t.me/apessimisticresearcher)
- Related Group for this club: [Classic Papers in programming languages by Amir Khaki](https://t.me/+mq883slDES9mZWNk)
---

## 🎯 Goals
1. **Read & discuss** the classic papers in the field.
2. **Write notes** that reflect personal understanding (not copy-paste).  
3. **Build small practical projects** inspired by the papers (algorithm implementations, etc.).  
4. Create a shared resource that grows into a **study guide** for everyone.

## 📂 Structure

```
📁 CS_ReadingClub/
├── 📁 week1/
│   ├── 📄 README.md          # Paper info + everyone's notes here
│   └── 📁 [your-name]/      # Your code & projects
├── 📁 week2/
└── ...
```

Every week, we update the notes and resources in the folders:

- [`/week1`](week1/): Notes and resources for Week 1 (Hoare Logic, Dijkstra's GCL)


## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Simple 3-Step Process:
1. **Fork the repo** & create a branch
2. **Add your contribution:**
   - 📝 **Notes**: Add directly to the week's README.md file 
   - 💻 **Code/Projects**: Create a folder with your name in that week
3. **Push and open a Pull Request**

### Example:
For Week 1, add your notes to `week1/README.md` and put any code in `week1/[your-name]/`

## 🌟 Why This Matters
- Writing notes forces deeper reflection and understanding.  
- A few months later, revisiting your notes will refresh the concepts.  
- Group effort ensures diverse perspectives.  
- Eventually, we can compile notes into a polished **community study guide**.  

---

## 🕒 Workflow
- Weekly meetings to discuss the paper and share insights will be announced in the Telegram group.
- If you don’t understand something, open an issue or discuss in the Telegram group — others can help.
